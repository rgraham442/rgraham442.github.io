        <h1>To start</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        
        <p>
           I am the stereotypycal socially-anxious nerd who prefers to spend their time sitting in isolation than actually talking to other people.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Before the strange line of thinking that lead me here I was brought up in a loving home to a mother, a father and a sister who acts like a mother at times.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What do I do?</h3>
        <p>
            Many things from here to there, I write stories both used for game campaigns (Dungeons and Dragons, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, and many more) and for myself (Short stories of every genre).
        <p>
            I also play several games, spend hours customising my tech and watch far too much TV.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The other stuff</h3>
        <p>
            I was born in North Tyneside, and lived in/around Newcastle Upon Tyne for all my years. I studied Digital Forensics at Northumbria University for the past 3 years and am currently training with QA to be an IT Consultant.
