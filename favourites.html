        <h2>General</h2>
        
        <p>
           If it has sci-fi as a main theme, I am interested. I like the majority of sci-fi based things simply because of how large in scale the worlds can get and how massive the history of the worlds are.

            I do admit to a love of horror, the most obvious style being the horror of the unfathomable (aka H.P Lovecraft) and the darker takes on the world at large.

        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>
            There are many games I play, both in the physical world and the difital. Here are a few choice favourites:
            <li>The Shadowrun Series - Harebrained Schemes</li>
            This series has reinspired my love of the Shadowrun core material, it's great
            <li>Pillars of Eternity - Obsidion</li>
            Another cRPG, like many of Obsidions games, story is key, which helps in my enjoyment of the game.
            <li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
            A staple of nerd culture, I've played as both DM and player and I am addicted to this game far too much.

        <h3>Rainmeter</h3>
        <p>
            Rainmeter is a desktop customisation suite that uses a combination of scripts and general design to improve how a desktop screen can look.
